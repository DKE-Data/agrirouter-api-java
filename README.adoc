== Abstract
image::agrirouter.svg[agrirouter]

The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and agricultural contractors that makes it possible to connect machinery and agricultural software, regardless of vendor or manufacturer. Agrirouter does not save data; it transfers data.
As a universal data exchange platform, agrirouter fills a gap on the way to Farming 4.0. Its underlying concept unites cross-vendor and discrimination-free data transfer. You retain full control over your data. Even data exchange with service providers (e.g. agricultural contractors) and other partners is uncomplicated: Data are very rapidly transferred via the online connection, and if you wish, is intelligently connected to other datasets.

support of the platform.

We are active maintainers of the SDK and are using the SDK for internal testing purposes as well. Therefore we have a

== The current project you're looking at

This project contains the SDK for the communication with the agrirouter. Everything you need for the onboarding process, secure communication and much more.

== Releases

The release workflow follows the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops[Microsoft DevOps Release Model] where a release shows up as a branch in the repository.

== Modules

=== `api` Module

The `api` module contains interfaces, common helper classes and DTOs as well as exceptions.

=== `impl` Module

The `impl` module contains the implementation of the given SDK defined by the `api` module.

=== `convenience` Module

The `convenience` module contains common implementations for different problems which are not located within the SDK. Those could be capability setting, MQTT client creation or other common problems that are normally not part of the SDK.

=== `test` Module

The `test` module contains integration tests not only for the SDK, but also for different scenarios.

=== Integration

If you want to add a dependency feel free to fetch the latest release from Github Packages. Please find the documentation right https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages[here].

If you want to add the packages, you need to define the settings within your `pom` or the `settings.xml` otherwise. If you need an example, you can either have a look at the `ci/settings.xml` for general purpose or check out the snippet below for a custom `settings.xml`.

[xml]
----
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

            <password>{{YOUR.GITHUB.ACCESS.TOKEN}}</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
----

You can use this `settings.xml` and include it during the build process in a specific way. Just use `mvn clean verify -s your_path_to_the_file/settings.xml` to use the settings if they are set in a local file.

=== Compatibility

We are supporting JDK 8 and later, releases are build using a JDK 8 to have compatibility for most users. If you need to build the current development branch, please feel free build the branch on yourself and install it to your local repository.

== Certificates for the communication

We do not longer maintain the certificates within the SDK.
Maintaining them in the SDK would mean, that we have to release the SDK with every change of the certificate.
Therefore feel free to add the root certificates to a Java Key Store add reference it within your application.

=== Adding a certificate to the JKS

The certificates are PEM files which can be added directly to the keystore using the following command.

[source]
----
keytool -importcert -file certificate.pem -keystore my_agrirouter_key_store.jks
----

If you try to add the command, please be aware, that the containing PEM file has to fulfill the following requirements:

* The header and footer are included enclosed between five dashes.
* There are no trailing spaces on each line.
* The certificate is saved as a .p7b.

If the files does not meet those requirements, the import will not be possible.
The certificates are part of the integration guide which can be found in the external resources.
