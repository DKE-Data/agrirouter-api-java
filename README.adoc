== Abstract

image::agrirouter.svg[agrirouter]

The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and agricultural contractors that makes it possible to connect machinery and agricultural software, regardless of vendor or manufacturer.
Agrirouter does not save data; it transfers data.
As a universal data exchange platform, agrirouter fills a gap on the way to Farming 4.0.
Its underlying concept unites cross-vendor and discrimination-free data transfer.
You retain full control over your data.
Even data exchange with service providers, (e.g., agricultural contractors) and other partners is uncomplicated:
Data is very rapidly transferred via the online connection, and if you wish, is intelligently connected to other datasets.

== The current project you're looking at

This project contains the SDK for the communication with the agrirouter.
Everything you need for the onboarding process, secure communication, and much more.

== Releases

The release workflow follows the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops[Microsoft DevOps Release Model] where a release shows up as a branch in the repository.

=== Update from 1.4.x to 2.x

The update for the new release includes some breaking changes.
To have a rough overview of what has to be done to have the new features from 2.x in your application, please see the following migration / update guide when updating.

==== Update the Maven dependencies

The first step is to update the coordinates of the dependencies.
With the release 2.x, the coordinates changed to a new name and a new version.

[xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.agrirouter.api</groupId>
        <artifactId>agrirouter-sdk-java-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.agrirouter.api</groupId>
        <artifactId>agrirouter-sdk-java-impl</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.agrirouter.api</groupId>
        <artifactId>agrirouter-sdk-java-convenience</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
----

==== Update package declarations for services and internal classes

Since the package declaration was updated along with the coordinates, there will be compiler errors that should be fixed.
Some classes have moved to a more meaningful package.

image::migration_1-4_to_2-0/compiler-errors-before.png[Compiler errors before the migration.]

The new package declaration added the protocol part (`http` or in this case the `mqtt`).

image::migration_1-4_to_2-0/package-declaration-after-refactoring.png[Package declaration after migrating.]

==== Update the usage of the enums for message types

To have a better understanding about system message types and content message types, the declaration for the different types has changed.
There are two new classes, the `ContentMessageType` for content messages and the `SystemMessageType` for system messages.
The former technical message type will cause a compiler error since it was replaced.

image::migration_1-4_to_2-0/former-technical-message-types.png[Former message types.]

The new declaration uses the system message type.

image::migration_1-4_to_2-0/system-message-type-afterwards.png[System message type usage afterwards.]

==== Remove former URLs for ProtoBuf message types

With the new release, the URLs can be fetched from the content message types and there is no need to put them into a helper method any longer.

image::migration_1-4_to_2-0/former-content-message-type-urls.png[Former content message types.]

With the new release, fetch, the URLs are way more comfortable.

==== Have a look at an example

The http://www.agrirouter-middleware.de[agrirouter middleware] has been updated after the release of version 2.x and can be an indicator regarding the workload for the migration.
Have a look at the following https://github.com/agrirouter-middleware/agrirouter-middleware/pull/12[PR #12] to see the necessary adaptions.

=== Update from 2.x to 3.x

With the release of version 3.x, the SDK now supports Java 17 and uses Jakarta EE 9.1, with this version you are no longer able to use Java 8.
We will continue to support Java 8 with the 2.x branch, but we will not add any new features to the 2.x branch.

== Modules

=== `api` Module

The `api` module contains interfaces, common helper classes and DTOs as well as exceptions.

=== `impl` Module

The `impl` module contains the implementation of the given SDK defined by the `api` module.

=== `convenience` Module

The `convenience` module contains common implementations for different problems which are not located within the SDK.
Those could be capability setting, MQTT client creation or other common problems that are normally not part of the SDK.

=== `test` Module

The `test` module contains integration tests not only for the SDK, but also for different scenarios.

=== Integration

If you want to add a dependency, feel free to fetch the latest release from GitHub Packages.
Please find the documentation right https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages[here].

If you want to add the packages, you need to define the settings within your `pom` or the `settings.xml` otherwise.
If you need an example, you can either have a look at the `ci/settings.xml` for general purpose or check out the snippet below for a custom `settings.xml`.

[xml]
----
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>github</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>

    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>github</id>
            <repositories>
                <repository>
                    <id>dke-data</id>
                    <name>GitHub DKE-Data Apache Maven Packages</name>
                    <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/DKE-Data/*</url>
                </repository>
            </repositories>
        </profile>
    </profiles>

    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>dke-data</id>
            <username>{{YOUR.GITHUB.USERNAME}}</username>
            <password>{{YOUR.GITHUB.ACCESS.TOKEN}}</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
----

You can use this `settings.xml` and include it during the build process in a specific way.
Just use `mvn clean verify -s your_path_to_the_file/settings.xml` to use the settings if they are set in a local file.

=== Compatibility

We are supporting JDK 17 and later, releases are build using a JDK 17 to have compatibility for most users.
If you need to build the current development branch, please feel free to build the branch on yourself and install it to your local repository.

== Certificates for communication

We do no longer maintain the certificates within the SDK.
Maintaining them in the SDK would mean that we have to release the SDK with every change of the certificate.
Therefore, feel free to add the root certificates to a Java Key Store add reference it within your application.

=== Adding a certificate to the JKS

The certificates are PEM files that can be added directly to the keystore using the following command.

[source]
----
keytool -importcert -file certificate.pem -keystore my_agrirouter_key_store.jks
----

If you try to add the command, please be aware that the containing PEM file has to fulfill the following requirements:

* The header and footer are included enclosed between five dashes.
* There are no trailing spaces on each line.
* The certificate is saved as a .p7b.

If the files do not meet those requirements, the import will not be possible.
The certificates are part of the integration guide which can be found in the external resources.
